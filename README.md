Note: since max has been away at a swim meet, tests and code has not been written for him yet

Three Use Cases that you will implement first:
1. - atm interactions
2. - teller interactions
3. - Account interactions

Which classes & methods do you need to implement for these use cases?
(Indicated which team member is responsible for the implemenation)
1. - Giovanni will implement atm, teller, software classes and tests for bank system class. his branch has not been merged but has been mostly implemented
2. - Matt implements all Account classes and user interface
3. -
4. -
5. << add more as needed >>

Don't forget to use Test-Driven Development (TDD)
1. Write Class and Method Function Headers
2. Write Tests
3. Implement Method Functions

Good Luck!
